# Power_BI-YouTube_Performace_Analytics

Project Overview:-

This project aims to create an interactive YouTube Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to visualize key metrics such as video views, likes, comments, dislikes, and overall engagement. The dashboard helps users track video performance, audience engagement, and provides actionable insights for optimizing content strategy.

Problem Statement:-

YouTube content creators and marketers often struggle to gain a clear understanding of how their videos perform over time. There is a need for an intuitive tool to track engagement metrics, identify trends, and analyze performance, helping users make data-driven decisions to enhance video content and grow their audience.

Task:-

• Data Loading: Imported YouTube video performance data into Power BI, including views, likes, comments, dislikes, and timestamps.

• Data Cleaning & Transformation: Cleaned and transformed raw data in Power BI, including handling missing or inconsistent values, and ensuring the data is ready for analysis.

• Dashboard Creation: Built interactive visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and filters to track video performance over time.

• Report Generation: Developed a comprehensive dashboard that allows users to drill down into individual video performance and analyze engagement trends.

Insights:-

• Views by Hour: Peak hours for maximum views are between 5 PM and 11 PM.

• Views and Likes by Month: Found patterns in video views and likes based on monthly trends. February, March, September, and December are identified as high engagement months.

• Views by Day: Highlighted which days videos receive the most views.

• Top 10 Most Viewed Video IDs: Listed the top 10 videos with the highest number of views.

• Top 10 Most Engaging Video IDs: Showcased the top 10 videos with the highest engagement rates (likes, comments, dislikes).

• Like-Dislike Ratio: Analyzed the ratio of likes to dislikes to understand audience sentiment.

Recommendations:

• Post during Peak Hours: Upload videos between 5 PM to 11 PM to maximize visibility.

• Plan around High-Engagement Months: Release content during February, March, September, and December, which have higher viewership and engagement.

• Analyze Top Videos: Evaluate the top 10 most viewed and engaging videos to understand audience preferences.

• Use Like-Dislike Ratio: Leverage the like-dislike ratio to gauge video reception and refine content strategy.

Used Technologies:-

• Power BI: To create interactive visualizations and dashboards.

• Excel/CSV Files: As the format for the dataset.

Conclusion:-

This YouTube Analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of video performance and engagement, offering key insights that can guide content strategy. By understanding peak hours (5 PM to 11 PM), popular videos, and audience sentiment through the like-dislike ratio, content creators can improve their posting schedules and overall content approach.
